        I want to take the Web Programming class to learn the skills required to build a website from start to finish.
        This class would enable me to break into the tech industry and get closer to my goal of becoming a Software
        Development Engineer. I hope to apply the skills that I learn in a future job. Web programming is still a new
        area for me; I currently only have a basic understanding of Python and SQL. I hope to gain more skills by the
        end of this semester.

    Below are a list of my top three favorite foods:
    <ol>
        <li>Hot Pot</li>
        <li>Chinese Style Seafood</li>
        <li>Authentic Tacos</li>
    </ol>

    <p>My favorite restaurant in the Greater Seattle Area is called Chengdu Memory. Here is a link to the <a
            href="https://www.chengdumemory.com/" target="_blank">Chengdu Memory Website.</a> I really like this
        particular
        restaurant because it brings authentic Sichuan-style hot pot close to where I currently live. Their hot pot has
        the
        best flavor among all the hot pot restaurants in the Seattle area. It has a salad bar filled with snacks and
        fruits
        that I get to eat for free while waiting for the dishes to be brought to the table. It also has a wide selection
        of
        dishes that I can order in smaller portions, allowing me to eat a variety of meats and vegetables in one meal.
        Despite its location being in an undesirable area, I am still a regular at that restaurant.</p>

        My favorite way to eat hot pot is to order two soupbase, one being very spicy and another one would be a bone
        broth based soup. I will then order thin sliced beef and lamb, some meatballs, and various vegetables on the
        side. I will cook all the food in the spicy broth and eat them with my customized dipping sauce. I don't
        typically cook anything in the non spicy side of the hot pot, but rather I will only drink the soup to help
        tolerate the spicy flavor. I will alway wrap up my hot pot meal with some fruits and ice cream at the end.
